Ray marching is a technique used in computer graphics to render 3D scenes using volumetric data, which is represented as a scalar field of density values. The idea behind ray marching is to cast a ray from the camera's position through each pixel of the screen, and then step along the ray in small increments, accumulating the density values encountered along the way, until the ray exits the volume or reaches a termination condition.

When ray marching into an object, the termination condition is typically defined as a threshold value of density, which determines when the ray has entered the object and should stop marching. The threshold value is usually set to a small positive value, since density values typically represent the distance to the nearest surface or boundary of the object, and negative values correspond to empty space.

To compute the density values along the ray, a density function is used, which takes a 3D point in space as input and returns a scalar value representing the density at that point. The density function can be defined in various ways, depending on the type of object being rendered and the desired appearance. For example, to render a sphere, the density function can be defined as the distance between the current point and the center of the sphere, minus the radius of the sphere.

The ray marching process is typically implemented using a loop in a shader program, which is executed for each pixel of the screen. The loop initializes the ray's starting position and direction, and then steps along the ray in small increments, computing the density values at each step using the density function, and accumulating them into a sum. The loop terminates when the accumulated density value exceeds the threshold value, indicating that the ray has entered the object, or when the ray exits the volume or reaches a maximum number of steps.

Once the loop has terminated, the accumulated density value is used to compute the color of the pixel, using a transfer function that maps density values to colors. The transfer function can be defined in various ways, depending on the desired appearance and lighting model.

Overall, ray marching with density functions allows for flexible and expressive rendering of complex volumetric objects, such as clouds, smoke, and other natural phenomena, as well as artistic and stylized effects. However, it can be computationally intensive and requires careful tuning of parameters to achieve good performance and visual quality.
